Sweden has export control laws governing export of cryptographic
software (SFS 1991:341 with additions, where SFS 1994:2060 is
particularly important). It is clear that these laws cover physical
export of software but it is not clear whether these laws also cover
electronic distribution. 'The Inspection for Strategic Products'
(Inspektionen för strategiska produkter tel: +46-(0)8-406 31 00) is
the agency handling export control issues. Please note that these laws
are currently being revised. We do not advise anyone to bring with
him, distribute or export this software outside of Sweden, without
being fully aware of the possible legal consequences.</b>

Pressing one of the tabs at the top of the page will select that
section of the configuation interface. Pressing the <em>selected</em>
button will focus on the top node of that part of the interface.<p> It
will probably make sense once you try it. You can always see where in
the configuration interface you are by looking at the grey statusrow
at the top of the page.

<p>

There are usually one or more buttons at the bottom of the page, to do
things that do not fit nicely in the 'node with subnodes'
methaphore, like adding a new virtual server, unfolding/folding more
than one node at the time etc, at the top or bottom of the
configuration interface.

<p>

Some buttons, like the 'add a new module' button are only available in
certain nodes (when a node of a certain type has been focused).
