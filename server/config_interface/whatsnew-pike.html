<h2>Pike changes since Pike 7.0</h2>

<rul>
<new-feature name='The Crypto module is always included'>
This includes SSL, complete with SSL client support.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='New refdoc system'> There is now a lot of inlined
documentation in the source-files, and an extractor to convert it to
XML. This is also used in Roxen.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Implicit lambda syntax'>

<pre>   function( arguments ) { block };</pre>

   The function will be called with an extra argument (the block as a
   lambda function) as it's argument.

   As an example, you can write:

<pre>   thread_create() {
     while( 1 ) { write("I am a thread\n"); sleep( 1 ); }
   };
</pre>
</new-feature>


<new-feature  name='#pike'>

  Pike files can now be identified with which version of pike they
  where written for with the preprocessor directive #pike. The Pike
  interpreter can then use the apropriate compatibility features.

<p>

  Note that this can also be used for older versions of Pike; a
  Pike 7.0 or 0.6 script won't take offence just because you add a
  #pike line in the beginning of it but it will give 7.2 or later
  versions of pike a fair chance of running it witout complaining
  about incompatible changes to pike that were introduced later. By
  running the pike with a -V 7.0 (or 0.6 in the example given), you
  explicitly tell the compiler to assume compatibility mode of the
  given version, except where overridden by other #pike directives.

</new-feature>               


<new-feature name='--features'>
 The pike binary can be started with the flag --features
 which will make it return a list of all "features"
 available. The subjective definition of a feature is
 something that depends on an external library, special
 features in the OS/hardware or extra compile options.

<p>

  More or less the same information is also available as an task in
  the 
<a href='actions/?action=feature_list.pike&class=debug_info'>Administration
  interface.</a>
</new-feature>


<new-feature              name='--info'>

  The --info flag shows, in addition to the feature list, some version
  and environment information about the pike binary. An example:

</pre>
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='All constructor/destructor and operator overloading functions (LFUNs) may now be static.'>

               Callbacks used for overloading, as well as create and
               destroy, may now be declared as static.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Improved error diagnostics.'>
     The Pike compiler will now provide better error messages, i.e. 
     more specific than "parse error" in many more cases than before.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Improved optimization.'>
   The global tree optimizer now performs parse tree transformations
   such as strength reduction. Many new low-level optimizations has
   also been done, such as tail recursion optimization is now applied
   in more cases.
<p>
  search() et al are now faster than before.
<p>
  Also, the Pike compiler itself is now 50% faster than before.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Labeled break and continue.'>
   Loops can now be labeled and referenced to from break
   and continue. Example:

<pre>
            int a, b;
          foo:
            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 4; i++) {
              a = i;
              switch (1) {
                case 1:
                  if (i &gt;= 3) break foo;
                  if (i &gt;= 2) continue foo;
              }
              b = i;
            }
            return ({a, b}); // Returns ({3, 1})

</pre>

               

<new-feature   name='Local variables at the same nesting depth may no longer overlap.'>

      This is a return to the behavior of Pike 0.6. (We promise not to
      change it again...) This may cause some compatibility problems
      with Pike 7.0 code. (See the #pike feature above)
<p>
      As an example, the following code is no longer valid:

<pre>
      int a = 10;
      int a = 20;
</pre>
               

<new-feature name='The GC has been rewritten'>
 Most of the GC has been rewritten from scratch. It now has a more
 well defined behaviour when destroy() functions are called in GC'd
 objects.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='the Simulate module is gone'>
  If you actually need Simulate, use #pike 7.0 and it will appear.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='SQL sprintf style arguments'>


     It is now possible to make sprintf style SQL queries with
     automatic, database specific quoting. Example:

<pre>
  db->query("SELECT * FROM things WHERE id > %d AND name LIKE %s",
             lowest, pattern);
</pre>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Support for implicit create().'>

               The following two class definitions are equivalent: 
<pre>
                   class Foo 
                   {
                     int a;
                     static string b;

                     static void create(int _a, string _b) 
                     {
                       a = _a;
                       b = _b;
                     }
                   }

                   class Foo(int a, static string b) 
                   {
                   }
</pre>
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Support for local constants.'>

               Constants can now be defined inside functions.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Support for the local::id syntax.'>

   Makes it possible to resolve symbols in the local scope. Example: 
<pre>
                   class A {

                     int foo() { return 1; }
                     int bar() { return foo(); }
                     int baz() { return local::foo(); }
                   }

                   class B {
                     inherit A;

                     int foo() { return 2; }
                   }
</pre>
               B()->bar() will return 2 while B()->baz() returns 1.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='type_of() and _type_of() now return the type type.'>
         Example: 

<pre>
        constant boolean = typeof(0)|typeof(1);
        boolean flag = 1;
                    
        int main( int argc, array(string) argv )
        {
           flag = (argc>1)?(int)argv[1]:flag;
           write( "Type of flag is %O\n", typeof(flag) );
           write( "Value of flag is %O\n", flag );
           return 0;
        }
</pre>
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='typedef syntax added.'>

               Example: 
<pre>
   typedef int(0..1) boolean;
   boolean flag = 1;
   
   int main( int argc, array(string) argv )
   {
     flag = (argc>1)?(int)argv[1]:flag;
     write( "Type of flag is %O\n", typeof(flag) );
     write( "Value of flag is %O\n", flag );
     return 0;
   }
</pre>
</new-feature>


               
<new-feature name='enum syntax added.'>

               Example: 
<pre>
    enum boolean {
       false,true
     }
     boolean flag = true;
</pre>
</new-feature>


<new-feature name='Added array Regexp match.'>
       Example: 
    
     <tt> Regexp("[0-9]+")->match( ({ "hello", "12", "foo17" }) );</tt><br />
      Returns ({ "12", "foo17" })
</new-feature>


<new-feature name='ADT.Stack'>
  A simple stack implementation. Previously known as Stack.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Cache'>
               Plugin-based generic caching system, supporting chain-deletion of records.
               Currently supported storage areas are RAM, GDBM, Yabu or MySQL databases,
               removal policies are explicit remove, time-constrained, size-constrained,
               combined.

</new-feature>               

<new-feature name=' Calendar '>
        The new Calendar module. There is a big <a
        href='http://community/_internal/cvsview!0/10257/1.7/0/FAQ'>FAQ</a>
        in its directory describing many of its capabilities.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Calendar_I '>
  The old Calendar module. Available as Calendar when #pike 7.0 is used.

</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Crypto.aes / Crypto.rijndael'>

    Rijndael is a block cipher, designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent
Rijmen, which was the winning candidate algorithm for the AES
(<a href='http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/'>http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/</a>). The cipher has a variable block length and key length.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Crypto.md2'>
The MD2 Message-Digest Algorithm, as defined in RFC 1319
    (http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc1319.html).

</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Geography'>

 Capable of converting between symbolic names for the countries to
the actual country name. It can convert between differnet kinds of
position systems such as longitude/latitude, UTM and Georef. The
conversion can be done on any type of ellipsoid. 18 of the most common
earth approximations are included.
</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Image.FreeType '>
   Very low-level support for FreeType 2.0, basically maps
   directly to the library. Inside Roxen it's much easier to use the
   built-in font support which wraps the low-level font handlers with
   a somewhat more userfriendly abstraction layer
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Math.Angle'>

 For easy use of angles in computations. It can handle degrees,
radians and gons and conversion between them. You can reference a
degree angle with degrees, minutes and seconds. Includes methods for
normalization, trigonometrical calculations etc.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Mird '>

 Glue module to libmird, a free simple database with transactions,
see <a
href='http://www.mirar.org/mird/'>http://www.mirar.org/mird/</a>
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='PDF'>

 This is a glue module to pdflib, a "half-free" PDF generating
library. This is not included in the binary releases for licensing
reasons.
</new-feature>

               
<new-feature name='Parser.XML.DOM '>

 An implementation of DOM Level 1. See <a href='http://www.w3.org/DOM/'>http://www.w3.org/DOM/</a>.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name=' Parser.XML.Tree '>

 An easy to use, lightweight module to traverse and manipulate XML
trees.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name=' Protocols.HTTP '>

    The API functions in Protocols.HTTP now take their URLs either as
    strings or Standards.URI objects. You also no longer need to set
    the authorization header on your own, if your URL contains
    user:password information (e g
    http://user:password@some.host.com/). Also, the convenience
    functions in this module now handles https URLs.

</new-feature>
               

<new-feature name='Protocols.IRC '>

    A client implementation of the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Protocols.SNMP '>

 Implements SNMP v1, according to RFC 1157:
<a href='http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc1157.html'>http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc1157.html</a>
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Standards.ISO639_2 '>

 A module providing mapping from ISO-639-2 language codes to
language names and vice versa.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Standards.URI '>

 Abstract class for URI:s (or URL:s) that both handles indexing
out/altering the various individual components of a URI and correct
resolving/reresolving of a URI with respect to another base URI, all
according with RFC 2396:
               <a href='http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc2396.html'>http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc2396.html</a>
<p>

 Protocols.HTTP now also accepts Standards.URI objects
 as input to all methods that previously used to accept
 only URL strings.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Stdio.Stat '>

    file_stat() and fdobj->stat() now returns Stdio.Stat objects
    instead of arrays. These objects emulate the behaviour of the
    previously used arrays, but also provide an easier to use
    interface. (See the #pike feature above)
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='Tools.AutoDoc '>

 Extracts the new inline documentation format. We will post more
information on this when this system has matured enough to build
working pike reference manuals. Some information is available in files
.autodoc_inlining and .autodoc_syntax in the top directory.
</new-feature>

               

<new-feature name='  system '>

 A module housing various operating system calls made available to
pike that previously used to be provided as efuns (hardlink, symlink,
resolvepath, umask, chmod, chown, chroot stc.). Be prepared to see
these efuns disappear to compat mode only in the future. They will,
however, of course be available in the system module.
</new-feature>
