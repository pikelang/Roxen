<h1>Release notes for Roxen 2.2</h1>


<h2>User level changes</h2>


<rul>

<new-feature name='Configuration interface changes'>
<b>'content boxes'</b> added in the config interface (the first page)

    If you want to write your own boxes, see the files in
    <i>config_interface/boxes</i>.
<p>

<b>Added memory to the toplevel tabs</b> in the configuration interface
   When you click on a toplevel tab, you return to the page you last visited below that tab, just like in Roxen 1.3, click again to go to toplevel

<p>
<b>The configuration interface now works with more browsers.</b>
Some HTML changes were made so that the configuration interface works
better with the Mozilla and Opera browsers.

<p>

<b>The ports tab has been merged into the site tabs.</b> 
The old (overview) ports tab is available under the globals tab.

<p>

<b>Two new themes added</b>; Square orange, and the new default theme
(old default now known as '2.0 and 2.1 theme').

</new-feature>


<new-feature name="Built-in MySQL Database">
 Roxen WebServer now comes bundled with MySQL, and the
 database is used for various things inside Roxen Webserver. Also, there is a
 new <a href='dbs/'>database administration interface</a> available
 inside the configuration interface.
</new-feature>


<new-feature name='New User-database and Authentication module system'>
The user-database and authentication module API has been redesigned.

<p> You can now have multiple user database and multiple authentication
modules, and the modules only has to implement one of the two services.

<p> Two example authentication modules are included, one that uses
cookies and one that use the normal 'Basic' authentication system.

<p> Two user database modules are currently available (unless you
count the htaccess module), the system user database and the ldap user
database. The system database uses getpwent on to access the normal system
users.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Improved security patterns and htaccess support'>
The module level security patterns and the htaccess files now include
many new options, and are compiled for quicker execution.

<p>The htaccess module now also acts as a user-database, so you can use
<tt>&lt;if&nbsp;user=username&gt;</tt> in your RXML pages (and, if you feel
like it, your module level security patterns) with users and groups
authenticated from the htaccess module, even if the page does not
otherwise use the htaccess permission system.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Major protocol module changes'>
<dl>
<dt><b>Gopher and fhttp removed</b>
<dd>The gopher and fhttp protocols has been removed. The former
because it has not worked for three years, and nobody noticed, and the
latter because it did only offer benchmark performance, it was not all
that useful for real life applications. However:
<p>
<dt><b>The HTTP protocol module has some C-optimizations</b>

<dd>Parts of the normal HTTP protocol module has been rewritten in C,
and some other optimizations has been done. Overall, the HTTP parsing
is now about twice as fast as it was in Roxen 2.1.
<p>
<dt><b>The HTTP protocol auto-encodes unicode</b>

<dd>Unicode characters in text data is now recoded to useable output charset. 
This includes recoding of unsupported characters to entities (as an
    example, when a $(B6b(B character is encountered and the output charset
    is iso-8859-1, or å and the output charset is iso-8859-9)
</dl>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Changes in the generic image cache'>
<ul>
  <li>The URLs for the images in the image cache are now encrypted
  before they are sent to the client. 

  <li>The user ID is now saved for the images, no authenticated user
  can get an image rendered for another authenticated user.
</ul>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='New generic arguments for the image-related tags'>
  <ul>
 <li> <b>span-width</b> and <b>span-height</b>. Like max-width and max-height, but if the image is smaller, it's padded to the specified size.

<p><li><b>crop=guides-cross</b> <b>guides-index=x,y</b>: Crop
  <i>around</i> the point specified by the intersection of the two
  guides. Useful with max-width=... and max-height=..., primary for
  thumbnail generation.

<p><li><b>crop=guides-region [guides-index=x1,y1[-x2,y2]]</b>
  Crop to the
    specified region before doing any scales. Also useful with
    max-width=... and max-height=... for thumbnail generation. If
    guides-index is x1,y1, the guides x1,y1 and x1+1,y1+1 will be
    used, counting from the left and the top, respectively.  If both
    the ending and starting indexes (x2,y2) are specified, thoose
    guides will be used.
</ul>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Every site configuration now has a compatibility level'>
 There is a new configuration variable "Compatibility level" for each
 site. This variable is queried by different modules to control minor
 compatibility issues in their behavior.

 <p>The variable is set to the latest version for every newly created
 site, but is then never changed automatically during upgrade. It's
 set to "2.1" for sites that are imported from earlier Roxen versions.

 <p>The intention with this variable is to make it easier to do small
 changes that aren't strictly compatible, but still avoid jeopardizing
 the compatibility when upgrading older sites.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Font handling changes'>
 FreeType 2 support added. Roxen can now render text using TrueType
 and PostScript Type1 fronts using FreeType 2.

<p>There are now more CIF (Compact Image Font) generation and
unpacking programs available in the bin directory.
</new-fetaure>

<new-feature name='New start script NT compatibility option'>
 The option <b>--strip-backslash</b> has been added. This causes all \
 in the URL to be transformed to /. Useful for NT-compatibility reasons
 on Unix, this behaviour has been the default on NT since Roxen 2.0.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='New NT service'>
  The NT service is now built-in to the ordinary roxen binary.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Auto detection of hung clients'>
  Minimum bandwidth - new method to detect and dispose of hung
  clients. This saves valuable resources in form of file descriptors
  and memory.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='New internal images'>
  /internal-roxen-pixel-colorname generates a pixel with the color
  colorname. colorname can be either a symbolic name like "darkgreen"
  or a precise value in the RGB color space like "0000ff". For example
  /internal-roxen-pixel-red or /internal-roxen-pixel-ff0000 will give
  you a 1x1pixel red image.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Supports FTP extensions for IPv6 and NATs'>
  Added support for <a
  href="http://community.roxen.com/developers/idocs/rfc/rfc2428.html">RFC
  2428 (EPRT & EPSV)</a>.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Cache overhaul'>
  Some caches has been rewritten for better speed and to avoid
  overcaching.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Performance improvements in throttling support'>
  Throttling support has been changed and optimzed to make it useful
  for sites with a lot of traffic.
</new-feature>
  

</rul>



<h2>RXML changes</h2>

<rul>
<new-feature name='Optimizations'>
The RXML parser has been optimized, mainly with the introduction of
p-code.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='P-code'>
 RXML is now compiled to p-code the first time it is run, then
 evaluated directly from this form on subsequent accesses to the same
 file. This means that the RXML does not have to be reparsed from the
 source code for each access, and the internal memory structures are
 reused.

 <p>The introduction of p-code also allows more advanced features in
 the &lt;cache&gt; tag, which now is powerful enough to allow you to
 tune RXML pages for substantial performance gains.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Entity indexing'>
Entity variables holding complex data types (lists of values etc) can
now be indexed using the <tt>&amp;scope.variable.index;</tt> syntax.
As an example, if the page requested has two form variables with the
name <tt>'file'</tt>, you can access them one at a time as
<tt>&amp;form.file.1;</tt> and <tt>&amp;form.file.2;</tt>,
respectively.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='&lt;cache&gt; improvements'>
 The &lt;cache&gt; tag now handles nested &lt;cache&gt; and
 &lt;nocache&gt; tags correctly by mixing evaluated and unevaluated
 RXML code in the cached entries. This allows caching to be used
 around complex RXML code while still keeping some part of it dynamic
 (such as the name of the visitor or an access counter).

 <p>The cache also handles variable assignments. You can e.g. do a
 costly sql query and assign the result to a variable inside a
 &lt;cache&gt;, and then use that cached value outside the
 &lt;cache&gt; tag to format it dynamically depending on a user set
 theme.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Emit extended'>
Emit now supports more filtering and sorting options.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Set and append'>
Set and append can now act as container tags, with the value inside them. As an example, to set the variable var.foo to bar, you can use <tt>&lt;set variable=foo&gt;bar&lt/set&gt;</tt>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Insert can now insert the "closest" file with a certain name'>
A new argument has been added to &lt;insert&gt; and &lt;use&gt;:
locate=filename. This will attempt to locate the specified file in the
directory the current file recides and all directories above that
directory, up to the root of the virtual filesystem.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='The expr argument is now more powerful'>

The expr argument (expression evaluation) can now handle much more
complex expressions. As an example, it can do type conversions, and
use complex datatypes.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Session handling'>
  
  New entities such as &amp;unique-id; and &amp;client.session; helps
  you make session driven applications with little effort. See also the Session tag module under New modules.
</new-feature>

</rul>

<h2>New modules</h2>

<rul>
<new-feature name='New image related module, GXML'> 
There is a new image generating module available, the GXML module. It
renders images from a XML language, and is quite easily extended with
new tags and operations (Roxen modules can add tags to GXML).

<p>
See the <a href='http://community.roxen.com/projects/webserver2.2/gxml1.html'>following examples</a> for some more information
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Email module'>
 A module for creating and sending mails.<br />
<ul>
<li> Mail is sent by SMTP protocol to the remote or local SMTP server. </li>
<li> Multiple headers. </li>
<li> MIME compliant. </li>
<li> Attachments. </li>
</ul>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Writefile'>
 A module that allows the creation of files from normal RXML using the
 &lt;writefile&gt; tag. Contributed by <a href='mailto:srb@cuci.nl'>Stephen R. van den Berg</a>.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='robots.txt generator'>
  Generates a robots.txt on demand from various information. 
</new-feature>
<new-feature name='Word highlighter'>
  Highlights the words stored in the form variable <tt>highlight</tt> in
  HTML pages, mostly useful for searchengines.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Whitespace sucker'>
  This module removes redundant whitespace from HTML pages.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Sizer'>
This module provides the <tt>&lt;page-size&gt;</tt> tag that 
 calculates the size of a page, including inline images, HTTP headers
 etc, and gives an estimates of the time it will take to download the
 page over various connections.<p> You can also use the <i>size</i>
 prestate to trigger the sizing process.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Table/Image Border Unveiler'>
Another helping module for HTML-writers. This one allows you to toggle the viewing of table and image borders using a prestate.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Implicit &lt;use&gt;'>
  Automatically &lt;use&gt; a package before parsing files.
<p>
  Useful for creating template files whose tags and variables are
  automatically included before any RXML parsing is done of the
  content files.

  <p>The tags defined in such templates also benefits from the p-code
  speedups.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Javascript support module'>
This module provides some tags to support javascript development (as
an example, Javascript popup menus)
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Simple MPEG streaming server'>
  A simple mpeg streaming server has been added, mostly for example purposes.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Session tag module'>

  Provides support for session handling in form of the &lt;session&gt;
  and &lt;force-session-id&gt; tags. Handles clients with cookie
  support turned off transparently for the RXML programmer and uses
  unguessable session ID's.

</new-feature>

</rul>


<h2>User level compatibility issues</h2>

<rul>

<new-feature name='The global variable "PID file" has been removed'>
 The start script now makes a PID file earlier to be better at
 avoiding duplicate server processes, and to work better together
 init.d scripts. The global variable "PID file" is no longer
 consulted, due to the "chicken-and-egg" problem that would occur
 then.

 <p>If you depend on the PID file location specified by the "PID file"
 variable, you need to move that setting to the start script, either
 by adding a --pid-file argument or by setting the environment
 variable ROXEN_PID_FILE.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='MODULE_DEBUG is no longer defined by default by the start script'>
 Previously the start script added the MODULE_DEBUG define when
 neither --with-debug nor --without-debug was given to it. That define
 turns on some extra debug checks which are useful when developing new
 Roxen modules, but wasteful in production use. It's now turned off by
 default to get maximum performance in production use. To turn it on,
 you now need to either add the new --module-debug argument, or run
 with --once.
</new-feature>

</rul>


<h2>News for developers</h2>

<rul>

<new-feature name='Hilfe protocol'>

  A Hilfe (interactive pike evaluator) protocol has been added.  You
  can use this to evaluate Pike expressions inside your running Roxen
  Server.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Protocol modules are found dynamically'>

  When Roxen starts, it search for protocol modules in the 'protocols'
  directory, there is no longer any hard-coded list of known
  protocols.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='New database APIs'>

  Two new APIs are available to module programmers. For more
  information, see the <a
  href='https://community.roxen.com/articles/014_db/'>Roxen Community
  article</a>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Built-in testsuite'>

  Roxen now has a built-in testsuite to verify that no regression
  occurs. It is started by supplying the argument --self-test to the
  start script.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Patches to the Java-module system by Tom Palmer applied'>
<ul>
    <li> Added cookies, prestates and time to the request object.
    <li> Added cache() method.
    <li> Allow module loading from paths beginning with ../
</ul>
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='The Roxen module path is searched for Pike modules'>
 It's possible to use Pike modules (.pmod files and directories)
 in Roxen modules in a convenient way. Roxen now adds all directories
 called "pike-modules" that are found in the Roxen module search path
 to the Pike module path. So you can simply put your Pike modules in a
 directory called "pike-modules" near your Roxen module, and its
 contents will be available when the Roxen module is loaded.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='How to make tags work well with &lt;cache&gt;'>
 The &lt;cache&gt; tag works by caching the result after evaluating
 its contents. It also caches any variable changes made with
 RXML.set_var, RXML.Context.set_var, RXML.Context.add_scope etc.

 <p>Changes directly in id-&gt;misc and RXML_CONTEXT-&gt;misc (aka
 id-&gt;misc-&gt;defines) is however not known by the cache system and
 therefore not saved in the cache entries. This can be a problem when
 tags uses either of those two mappings to pass state between each
 other. A (rather silly) example to illustrate:

<pre>
&lt;my-set value="foo"/&gt;    &lt;!-- Does id-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value = "foo" --&gt;
...
&lt;my-get/&gt;                &lt;!-- Returns id-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value --&gt;
</pre>

 <p>Now, if &lt;my-set&gt; is surrounded by a &lt;cache&gt; tag, there's
 a problem:

<pre>
&lt;cache&gt;
  &lt;my-set value="foo"/&gt;  &lt;!-- Does id-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value = "foo" --&gt;
&lt;/cache&gt;
...
&lt;my-get/&gt;                &lt;!-- Returns id-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value --&gt;
</pre>

 <p>When the &lt;cache&gt; tag is evaluated the second time, it won't
 redo the assignment id-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value = "foo", since it
 doesn't know it has happened. Therefore &lt;my-get/&gt; will not
 return the same thing.

 <p>There are two ways to solve this:

 <ul>
  <p><li>Use RXML.set_var and similar functions to set values instead,
  e.g:

<pre>
&lt;cache&gt;
  &lt;my-set value="foo"/&gt;  &lt;!-- Does set_var("my_value", "foo", "var") --&gt;
&lt;/cache&gt;
...
&lt;my-get/&gt;                &lt;!-- Returns get_var("my_value", "var") --&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The set_var call is intercepted by the cache, so it will be
  redone when the cached value is reused. The downside of this
  approach is that the variable will be user accessible (with
  &amp;var.my_value; in this example).

  <p><li>Use RXML_CONTEXT-&gt;set_misc to set the values, e.g:

<pre>
&lt;cache&gt;
  &lt;my-set value="foo"/&gt;  &lt;!-- Does RXML_CONTEXT-&gt;set_misc("my_value", "foo") --&gt;
&lt;/cache&gt;
...
&lt;my-get/&gt;                &lt;!-- Returns RXML_CONTEXT-&gt;misc-&gt;my_value --&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This is very similar to the approach above, except that the
  variable won't be user accessible. The function set_misc simply sets
  a value in RXML_CONTEXT-&gt;misc but also records the setting for
  the cache.

 </ul>
</new-feature>

</rul>


<h2>Developer level compatibility issues</h2>

<rul>

<new-feature name='Different format for RoxenModule.module_identifier()'>
 The function module_identifier in Roxen modules has been changed to
 return a string on the same format as Roxen.get_modname. The old
 format was bulkier and not guaranteed to be unique for the module.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Different type handling for RXML.Value and RXML.Scope objects'>
 The responsibility to do type conversion for values from RXML.Value
 and RXML.Scope objects has been moved from the caller to the callee
 (i.e. RXML.Value.rxml_var_eval and RXML.Scope.`[]). It is therefore
 an error to ignore the fourth RXML.Type argument to these functions.
 The inline doc for RXML.Value.rxml_var_eval contains motivation and
 further discussion of this.
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='Changed API in RXML.TagSet.create'>
 The way to create new RXML tag sets has changed slightly due to
 encoding issues when p-code is dumped to disk. It's however fairly
 simple to update the create call. Previously, tag sets were typically
 created with something like this:

 <pre>RXML.TagSet internal = RXML.TagSet("TagFoldlist.internal", ({ TagFT(), TagFD() }) );</pre>

 <p>The first argument should earlier be a string that uniquely
 identifies the tag set in the whole server (which the one in the
 example above from the foldlist module clearly doesn't). Now, one
 instead gives the own module as the first argument and a string that
 only should identify the tag set uniquely within the module (the
 empty string is reserved for the main module tag set). The example
 above thus becomes:

 <pre>RXML.TagSet internal = RXML.TagSet(this_module(), "foldlist", ({ TagFT(), TagFD() }) );</pre>

 <p>For tag sets that are used for local or additional tags inside a
 container tag, it's typically a good idea to use the name of the
 container tag as the unique identifier, hence "foldlist" above. (Note
 that these identifier strings are stored in the dumped p-code, so
 it's a good idea to keep them fairly short.)
</new-feature>

<new-feature name='The Roxen module Debug.pmod renamed RoxenDebug.pmod'>
 This is to avoid a name conflict with Debug.pmod that comes with Pike.
</new-feature>
