• Preserve query variables when redirecting directory paths without trailing slash. [WS-411]

• Fixed mixed use of redirected_raw_url and redirected_not_query

• Index files only: Don't redirect to internal path

If the request has been redirected internally, don't expose the internal
path to the browser when making the redirect to add a trailing slash to
the URL. [roxen.com #28397]
