• Image cache: Log info if generated image data is too big for image cache. [WS-527]

• Image cache: Made max data size configurable. [WS-527]

• Image cache: Support data larger than 16 MB. [WS-527]

• Variable.TableChoice: Fixed type error.

• Variable.DatabaseChoice: Fixed typo.

• Variable: Move variables using DBManager to separate files.

The DBManager must not be loaded too early, as loading of it has major
side-effects, and too early load may cause Roxen to fail to start.

Fixes [WS-532].
