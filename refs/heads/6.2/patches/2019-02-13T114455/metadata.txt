• Protocols: Adjusted protocol overhead calculation somewhat.

* The time spent in http_request_init() is now included
  in the protocol_time.

* The time spent in json_logger->log() should not be
  included in the protocol_time.

• Logging: Added support for logging of $protocol-time.

Also fixes a minor documentation typo.

Fixes remainder of [WS-395].

• Protocols: Keep track of the time spent in protocol overhead.

Adds RequestID()->protocol_time.

Fixes some of [WS-395].
