â€¢ FTP: Add override for PASV address.

When the server is behind a NAT, clients that still use the ancient
PORT command would get the internal address and then (depending on
the client) fail when attempting to use it (some clients only use
the port number part and thus work fine).

Fixes [WS-639]/[EP-1805].
