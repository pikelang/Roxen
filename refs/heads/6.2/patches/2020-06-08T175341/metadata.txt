• Relay2: Support the HEAD method.

For the HEAD method data is never sent even when Content-Length != 0.

Fixes [WS-603] some more.

• Relay2: Reuse already opened connections.

Adds a connection cache for the proxy connections.

Fixes remainder of [WS-603].

• Relay2: Use keep-alive requests and HTTP/1.1.

Note that the connection isn't actually reused (but could be).

Fixes some of [WS-603].
