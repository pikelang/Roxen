• Configuration Interface [SNMP]: Fix display of SNMP for modules.

Only the first SNMP value was shown due to the traversal being
terminated early.

Fixes [WS-5] some more.

• Debug: Added provider hook "handler-done-hook".

This hook is called every time a handler has completed a task.
As it is only intended to be used for debugging purposes, it is
only enabled when the server has been started with --debug.

• ABS: Added provider hooks for adding info to ABS output.

Adds support for "abs-hook" and "describe-thread".

• Roxen.Null: Added cast operator.

Support casting of Roxen.null (aka Val.null) to some common basic types.

Fixes [WS-650].
