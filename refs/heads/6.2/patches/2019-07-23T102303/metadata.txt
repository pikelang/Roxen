• Diagnostics: Added OUTGOING_PROXY_DEBUG.

Also added some trivial validation of the proxy url before using it.

Fixes [WS-525].

• git-rxnpatch: Added a note about use of "git diff --relative=".

Fixes QA issue from [WS-522]/[WS-520].

• git-rxnpatch: Always use globs for distignore filtering.

Improves compatibility with distignore.pike.

Fixes QA issue from [WS-518]/[WS-516].

• Documentation [WebDAV]: Some minor clarifications.

Fixes QA note in [WS-512]/[WS-513].

• git-rxnpatch; Use "." to refer to the current directory.

Fixes "fatal: empty string is not a valid pathspec. please
use . instead if you meant to match all paths".

Fixes [WS-520].

• git-rxnpatch: More distignore fixes.

• git-rxnpatch: Support globs in .distignore files.

Fixes [WS-516].

• Documentation: Some AutoDoc markup updates.

• PropertySet: Added support for the DAV:ishidden property.

Resources that have filenames beginning with "." now get the
DAV:ishidden property set to "1". All other resources get it
set to "0".

Note that this property is one that Microsoft proposed in
an ietf draft (draft-hopmann-collection-props-00) in late
1998, which never got any discussion and expired in 2000.

Also some minor clean up.
