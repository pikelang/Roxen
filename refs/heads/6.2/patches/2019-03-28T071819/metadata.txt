• Cache: Use HeapElement::value consistently.

Do not use a mix of HeapElement::value and Element::value
to refer to the same variable.

Fixes QA note.

• Implement a cache value multiplier callback that objects can provide to
dynamically adjust the priority of an entry. The multiplier will be queried
for newly added entries and then periodically in after_gc(). [EP-1227]

• git-rxnpatch: Support distignore files outside the repository.

Fixes [WS-433].
