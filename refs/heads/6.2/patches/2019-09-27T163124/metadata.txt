• HTTP: Break 401/404 directory scan after first missing directory.

Alleviates a denial of service attack.

Fixes [WS-553] and most of [CMS-652].

• RXML: Support throwing of the empty string from <throw/>.

Fixes [WS-554].

• Fastpipe: Avoid throwing errors from sendfile_done().

sendfile_done() is called from a backend callback (not to be confused
with a call_out), at a point where an error may cause the backend to
enter an inconsistent state (exec_thread not being reset to NULL).

Fixes [WS-545].
