• Testsuite [RXML]: Updated error-handling tests to [WS-475].

Fixes [WS-482].

• RXML: Improved diagnostics in VERBOSE_RXML_ERRORS mode.

• RXML: Simplified rxml_{parse,run}_error().

Formatting of the errors is now done by report_error().

Fixes remainder of [WS-475].

• RXML.Parser: Changed calling convention for report_error().

report_error() for the Parser now assumes responsibility for
quoting and formatting error messages.

This makes for a more robust handling of quoting of errors.

Fixes some of [WS-475].
