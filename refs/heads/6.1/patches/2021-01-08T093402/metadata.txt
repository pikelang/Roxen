• Configuration Interface [SNMP]: Fix display of SNMP for modules.

Only the first SNMP value was shown due to the traversal being
terminated early.

Fixes [WS-5] some more.

• Roxen.Null: Added cast operator.

Support casting of Roxen.null (aka Val.null) to some common basic types.

Fixes [WS-650].
