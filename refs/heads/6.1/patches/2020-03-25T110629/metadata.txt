â€¢ RXML [GC]: Fixed memory leak.

The RXML CompositeTagSet cache had a too primitive gc, in that
it threw away the entire cache every 30 minutes. This caused
composite tag sets to be recreated every 30 minutes even if
they were still in use.

The RXML compositeTagSet cache now instead uses weak references
to only throw away the unused tag sets.
