â€¢ Variable.Schedule: Fix handling of DST transition.

Fix issue where next_day() returned a time one hour into the
next day rather than at hour 0 if the transition to dst was
in the interval. This in turn caused next_or_same_time() to
skip a week ahead if the targetted time was 00:00.

Fixes [WS-606].
