• ABS: Some fixes for sending of ABS email.

• Testsuite: Fix parameters.

• Testsuite: Fix cut-n-paste typo.

Fixes [REP-99] some more.

• Testsuite: Avoid anonymous background failures.

• Testsuite [RXML]: Turn off cache eviction during <cache>-tag tests.

Fixes [REP-99].

• Testsuite [RXML]: Added tag <cache-control>.

This tag is intended to be used to turn off automatic eviction
from specific caches in order to get more reliable results when
testing caching.

Needed for [REP-99].

• Cache: Added CacheManagerPrefs option to inhibit eviction.

This may be needed in some circumstances (eg the test suite) to get
consistent and predictable results from code using the main cache.

Needed for [REP-99].
