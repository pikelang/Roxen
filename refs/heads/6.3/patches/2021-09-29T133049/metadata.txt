• RoxenConcurrent.Promise.HandlerBackend: Avoid parent pointer.

HandlerBackend having a parent pointer causes a reference loop
between it and RoxenConCurrent.Promise.

• Testsuite: Enable gc cycle logging during the testsuite.

Unintended circularities are often the underlying cause of
testsuite failures, so make it easier to identify them.
