Multiple fixes:

• ConfigIF: Make expert options reachable again.

• SQLKey: Release any remaining locks when dropping the key.

Remaining locks may confuse later queries if the connection is reused.

Also drops the connection if the selected db has been changed (like
eg when select_db() has been called.

Requires recent Pike to have any effect.

Potential fix for [REP-290].
