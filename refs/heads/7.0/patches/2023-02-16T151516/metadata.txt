• FTP: Added implementation of OPTS UTF-8 and OPTS UTF8.

These are currently just a NOOP. OPTS UTF-8 is defined
by draft-ietf-ftpext-utf-8-option-00 (expired 2002-11-28),
and OPTS UTF8 does not seem to have any documentation,
but is used by several clients.

• FTP: Added help for some more commands.

Also adds support for having multiple sets of arguments
separated by '\n'. This is currently only used by the
help for SITE UTIME.

• FTP: More filename normalization.

Also fixes issue with MLSD where raw wide strings were sent.

• FTP: Updated translation string for EPRT.

• FTP: Fix typo in EPRT message.

Fixes [WS-341].

• FTP: Added locale markers for the user visible text.

It should now be possible to translate the ftp message strings
to different languages, and use LANG to select those languages.

• FTP: Implemented LANG from RFC 2640.
