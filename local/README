fonts/

  Roxen WebServer will search for font files in this directory per
  default. It is recommended that you place your own fonts here, if
  you wish to add new fonts to your WebServer installation, instead
  of placing them in the nfonts directory in the server directory.
  That way you will avoid making your fonts unavailable if you
  upgrade your server.

modules/

  Roxen WebServer will search for server modules in this directory
  per default. It is recommended that you place your own modules
  here, if you wish to add new modules to your WebServer
  installation, instead of placing them in the modules directory
  in the server directory. That way you will avoid making your
  modules unavailable if you upgrade your server.

packages/

  The Roxen WebServer update client will put its downloaded packages
  in this directory.

pike_modules/

  Pike will search for pike modules in this directory per default.
  It is recommended that you place your own pike modules here, if
  you wish to add new pike modules to your WebServer Pike
  installation, instead of placing them in the modules directory
  in the pike directory. That way you will avoid making your
  pike modules unavailable if you upgrade your server.
