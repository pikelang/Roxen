Changes since Roxen 2.1.115
-----------------------------------------------

o GIF support disabled per default to make Unisys happy.

o Updated all Roxen parts and products to work without GIF support.


Changes since Roxen 2.1.112
-----------------------------------------------

o Typo that prevented that Administration Interface from loading
  fixed.

o The bug that prevented you from running a Roxen from a path
  containing a symlink has been found and eliminated. (Thanks Mirar!)


Changes since Roxen 2.1.105
-----------------------------------------------

o New filesystem module that mounts tar-files.

o The manual is not unpacked any longer, but instead mounted directly
  from the tar-file. This solves the issue with long paths in the
  manual in a more robust way than earlier attempts.

o Fixed strange problem that prevented disk_cache.pike to compile on
  systems without threads.

  (This would be the problem Boyd had some weeks ago.)

o Fixed numerous smaller bugs.


Changes since Roxen 2.0
-----------------------------------------------

o Configuration variables are now widgets in their own right, and it
  is easy for module developers to develop their own type of variables.

o The fonts are now loaded by plugins, it's relatively easy to add new
  font formats to roxen.

  The currently supported formats are:
   o Compatibility bitmap fonts
   o The old font format, one file per font, uncompressed 8bpl bitmaps
   o TTF fonts
   o TrueType fonts, using freetype
   o Image directory
     A directory with a file 'fontname' and one image per character.
     The images can use any format Roxen knows.
   o Image TAR file
     Just like an image directory, but in a TAR file
   o Compact Image File
     Basically just like the image tar format, but more optimal. There
     is 8 bytes overhead per character, and 68 bytes header.

o Pike tag module
  <?pike ... ?>;  XML compliant processing instruction for pike-code. 

   o //X text-here   parses the text as if it was RXML. 
   o //O text-here   returns the text as if it was HTML. 
   o scope.variable is handled like &amp;scope.variable; in RXML. 
   o #inherit will inherit a file from the roxen filesystem, and
     #include will include one. 
   o The magic with parse() functions and whatnot is removed. 

  Small example:

  <?pike

   //O <pre>
   int first = 1; 
   for( var.counter=100; var.counter>1; var.counter--,first=0 )
   {
     if( !first )
     {
       //X &var.counter; bottles of beer on the wall
       //O
     }
     //X &var.counter; bottles of beer on the wall
     //X &var.counter; bottles of beer
     //O take one down, pass it around
   }
   //O one bottle of beer on the wall
   //O one bottle of beer
   //O take it down, pass it around
   //O no bottles of beer on the wall
   //O </pre>;

  ?>    

o Perl module
  A module for embedded perl.
  <?perl ... ?> and <perl></perl> in RXML pages.
  .pl pages for CGI-like interface that is much faster than CGI.

o Processing instructions in the low-level RXML parser
  <?... ?> tags can now be registered.

o New locale system
  Completely new locale/translation system with XML-based language files
  (in server/translations).

o New and changed tags
  o <wash-html>...</wash-html> do some common text->html tasks. 
  o <?comment ..... ?> 
  o <if sizeof=.../> 
  o <sprintf [split=separator] format=...>values,...</sprintf> 
  o <sscanf variables=a,b,... format=...>data</sscanf>
  o &_.scopename; will be the name of the default scope, if scopename
    is not used as a variable in that scope.
  o <dice type='3D6+D4'>
  o <fsize> now prints the size in a somwhat less user-unfriendly way. 
  o <gbutton> can now have images above or below the text (for toolbar
    style images).
  o <cimg> checks mtime on the source file (if any). 
  o <date strftime=format>
  o <vform>, with which you can create self-verified forms. Uses the
    same widgets as the configuration variables.

o Servlets
  o File extension servlets added, as an example, for .jsp pages.
  o Better classpath handling. 

o The directory module
  o The Directory module now uses a template and normal RXML (using
    emit sources directory and path) to generate the lists.
  o The directory and path emit sources can also be used to generate
     other directory lists, such as image listings with thumbnails.

o Emit
  o New sources
    o fonts - A list of all fonts available. 
    o directory - Directory listings. 
    o path - Separate a path on '/'. 
    o values - Traverse a list, e.g. the response from a multivalue select. 
    o cimg - Like the <cimg> tag, but entity based. 
      Includes &_.type;, &_.src;, &_.file-size;, &_.xsize;, &_.ysize;
               and &_.data; 
    o ldap - LDAP search query. 
  o Emit can now sort the result. 
  o You can now select a sub-range of the result. 
  o remainderinfo=variablename (number of lines after current selected range). 

o HTTP protocol module
  o The module is greatly optimized. For a 100Kb file it went from 112
    to 640 req/seconds.
  o There is now a memory cache that can be used to optimize the
    server. For a 10Kb file, the performance went from 240 to 1490
    req/second. The cache can be configured on the Settings page for
    each Site.



Those are the main changes. Naturally, there has been lots of bug fixes
too. Notably, CGI works properly on NT now, and the stability of Java
on said platform has been drasticly improved.
